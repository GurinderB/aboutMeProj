            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p class="aboutme">
                I was born and raised in India. I moved to U.S. in 2006 to pursue Bachelor's in Computer Science. I completed my B.S. degree from Lincoln University, Jefferson City, Missouri. I was also working as help desk specialist with Lincoln University while I was studying. Towards the end of my degree I moved to different department and started working as Programmer Analyst. In 2013 I joined in U.S. Army working a Supply Specialist. Currently I am working towards getting my foot back in the IT sector.
